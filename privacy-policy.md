## The COVFIT study: Privacy policy

[COVFIT study home page](https://www.covfitstudy.ca)

The COVFIT research team built the COVFIT app as a free app intended to support the COVFIT research study. This study has been approved by the University of Toronto Health Sciences Research Ethics Board (REB) (RIS Protocol #42166). This app is provided by researchers at University of Toronto at no cost and is intended for use as is. Use of this app is meant only for participants of the COVFIT research study who have already provided informed consent.

This page is used to inform visitors regarding our policies with the collection, use, and disclosure of Personal Information of anyone who decides to use the COVFIT app.

If you choose to use our app, then you have already reviewed and signed the informed consent form which outlines all data collected through our app. The data that we collect is used for research purposes as outlined in the informed consent form. We will not use or share your information with anyone except as described in the informed consent form.

**Information Collection and Use** <br/>
We do not collect personally identifiable information through usage of the COVFIT app.

**Log Data** <br/>
We do not collect or retain log data.

**Cookies** <br/>
Cookies are files with a small amount of data that are commonly used as anonymous unique identifiers. These are sent to your browser from the websites that you visit and are stored on your device's internal memory.

The COVFIT app does not use these “cookies” explicitly. However, the app may use third party code and libraries that use “cookies” to collect information and improve their services. If you choose to refuse our cookies, you may not be able to use some portions of this Service.

**Security** <br/>
Remember that no method of transmission over the internet, or method of electronic storage is 100% secure and reliable, and we cannot guarantee its absolute security.

**Links to Other Sites** <br/>
The COVFIT app may contain links to other sites and apps. If you click on a third-party link, you will be directed to that site or app. Note that these external sites and apps are not operated by us. Therefore, we strongly advise you to review the Privacy Policy of these websites and apps. We have no control over and assume no responsibility for the content, privacy policies, or practices of any third-party sites or services.

**Use of Third-Party Services** <br/>
The COVFIT Research Study app uses Firebase Crashlytics, a third-party service for collecting diagnostic reports that help us troubleshoot app crashes. In the rare circumstance that the COVFIT app crashes during use, a crash report may be sent to Firebase for us to review. Crash reports do not include your personal information, do not include your HealthKit data, and are not used for tracking purposes. 

Google has provided the following examples of stored device information collected by Crashlytics: <br/>
• An RFC-4122 UUID which permits us to deduplicate crashes <br/>
• The timestamp of when the crash occurred <br/>
• The app's bundle identifier and full version number <br/>
• The device's operating system name and version number <br/>
• A boolean indicating whether the device was jailbroken/rooted <br/>
• The device's model name, CPU architecture, amount of RAM and disk space <br/>
• The uint64 instruction pointer of every frame of every currently running thread <br/>
• If available in the runtime, the plain-text method or function name containing each instruction pointer <br/>
• If an exception was thrown, the plain-text class name and message value of the exception <br/>
• If a fatal signal was raised, its name and integer code <br/>
• For each binary image loaded into the application, its name, UUID, byte size, and the uint64 base address at which it was loaded into RAM <br/>
• A boolean indicating whether or not the app was in the background at the time it crashed <br/>
• An integer value indicating the rotation of the screen at the time of crash <br/>
• A boolean indicating whether the device's proximity sensor was triggered <br/>
